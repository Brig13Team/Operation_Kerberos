/*
    This is an example for a script that uses the CBA state machine system.
    In this case, we're "sharpening the senses" of AI units that got attacked before.
    Once they had contact, they stay alert.

    This would simulate units that did not expect an attack, but are now aware that
    they might come under fire again.

    You can test this example by executing the following code in the debug console:
    [] call compile preprocessFileLineNumbers "\x\cba\addons\statemachine\example.sqf"
